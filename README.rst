       HTTP/LDAP Gateway /_/


Adding LDAP support can be time-consuming, tedious and complex â€” but it doesn't have to be.

Redap is an easily deployable micro-service, providing an API for interacting with LDAP-capable directory servers over HTTP.

Features
------

Redap was partly inspired by and is conceptually similar to `dthree/addict <https://github.com/dthree/addict>`_, but comes with more features.

- RESTful HTTP API
- API key authorization
- LDAP debugging
- Custom schemas
- LDAP3 *Simplified Query Language*
- Docker image with flask, uwsgi and nginx
- SwaggerUI
