       HTTP/LDAP Gateway /_/


Motivation
-------
Adding LDAP support to an application can be a time-consuming, tedious and complex task.

Redap adds an abstraction layer on top of LDAP, in its own little habitat—or micro-service, if you will—providing flexibility, customizability and simplicity.


Features
------

Redap was partly inspired by and is conceptually similar to `dthree/addict <https://github.com/dthree/addict>`_, but offers more features:


- RESTful HTTP(S) API
- API key authorization
- Custom schemas
- Simplified Query Language
- LDAP debugging
- Robust application stack
- Production-ready Docker image
- SwaggerUI


Getting started
-------------
Check out `the wiki <https://github.com/rbw0/redap/wiki>`_ for guides, client examples and more.
